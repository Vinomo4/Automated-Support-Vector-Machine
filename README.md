> An Automated version of an SVM (programmed in AMPL) using Python which includes primal/dual problem formulation and several methods for point generation

## Introduction

This project aims to create an SVM using AMPL coding both formulations of the problem (Primal and Dual) for the subsequent classification of points, the generation of which is performed randomly, to check the performance of the created SVM depending on the selected method of generation.

Another objective was allowing the user to perform the random point generation, the selection of the formulation of the problem and, after the classification is performed, the calculation of the accuracy achived by the SVM automatically. To do so, a Python script was created that, using the AMPL models previously created, performs all this tasks ina user-friendly interface.
